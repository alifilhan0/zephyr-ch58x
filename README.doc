# CH5XX repository for Zephyr RTOS development.

### This repo was based off from initial work done in https://github.com/xingrz/zephyr. But my main purpose is to ultimately port CH5XX boards to ZMK alongside bring wireless and USB support.

-	Qingke-VX(2,3,4).
-	PFIC.
-	GPIO & Pinctrl.
-	Systick timer for the core

What needs to be added (TODO for Alif Ilhan)

-	BLE
- ADC
-	USB
-	PWM and GPTimers.
- I2C

- DMA
